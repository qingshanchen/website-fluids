Qingshan Chen is an Associate Professor of Mathematics at Clemson University. He obtained
a Ph.D. in applied mathematics from [Indiana University](http://www.math.indiana.edu) in 2009, under the supervision of [Professor
Roger Temam](http://mypage.iu.edu/~temam). 
He spent two years at FSU, working with [Professor Max Gunzburger](http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~mgunzburger/) on regional climate
modeling. Afterwards, he spent two years at the Los Alamos Nat'l Lab, working with [Dr. Todd Ringler](http://www.toddringler.me)
and the COSIM group
on ocean and climate modeling.
In 2013, he joined the computational math group at Clemson University.
