# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "When the length scale of the flow is on the same order as the Rossby deformation radius, which is often the case in the interior of the flow, the classical rigid-lid assumption is no longer valid, the impact of the free surface/interface deformations on the the vorticity field is no longer negligible, and therefore it has to be accounted for in the model. In this talk, we present some new results concerning the well-posedness of the barotropic quasi-geostrophic equation and the multi-layer QG equations, where the top surface, and the layer interfaces for the multilayer QG, are left free to evolve. It is shown that, when the free surface/interfaces are included as components of the potential vorticity, the models remain globally well-posed, under certain generic assumptions on the initial state and the boundary of the domain."
