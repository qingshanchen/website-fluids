  abstract = "A new energy and enstrophy conserving scheme (EEC) for the
              shallow water equations is proposed and evaluated using a suite
              of test cases over the global spherical or bounded domain.The
              evaluation is organized around a set of pre-defined properties:
              accuracy of individual operators, accuracy of the whole scheme,
              conservation of key quantities, control of the divergence
              variable, representation of the energy and enstrophy spectra, and
              simulation of nonlinear dynamics. The results confirm that the
              scheme is between the first and second order accurate, and
              conserves the total energy and potential enstrophy up to the time
              truncation errors. The scheme is capable of producing more
              physically realistic energy and enstrophy spectra, indicating
              that it can help prevent the unphysical energy cascade towards
              the finest resolvable scales. With an optimal representation of
              the dispersive wave relations, the scheme is able to keep the
              flow close to being non-divergent, and maintain the
              geostrophically balanced structures with large-scale geophysical
              flows over long-term simulations.",
