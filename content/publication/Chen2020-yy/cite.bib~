  abstract = "An energy-conserving and an energy-and-enstrophy conserving
              numerical schemes are derived, by approximating the Hamiltonian
              formulation, based on the Poisson brackets and the
              vorticity-divergence variables, of the inviscid shallow water
              flows. The conservation of the energy and/or enstrophy stems from
              skew-symmetry of the Poisson brackets, which is retained in the
              discrete approximations. These schemes operate on unstructured
              orthogonal dual meshes, over bounded or unbounded domains, and
              they are also shown to possess the same optimal dispersive wave
              relations as those of the Z-grid scheme.",
