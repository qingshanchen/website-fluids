 abstract = {A general framework for goal-oriented a posteriori error
estimation for finite volume methods is developed. The framework
does not rely on recasting finite volume methods as special cases
of finite element methods, but instead directly determines error
estimators from the discretized finite volume equations. Thus,
the framework can be applied to arbitrary finite volume methods.
It also provides the proper functional settings to address
well-posedness issues for the primal and adjoint problems.
Numerical results are presented to illustrate the validity and
effectiveness of the a posteriori error estimates and their
applicability to adaptive mesh refinement.},
