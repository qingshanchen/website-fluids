abstract = "The inviscid barotropic quasi-geostrophic equation with a free surface is considered. The free surface mandates a non-standard boundary condition. The global existence existence and uniqueness of a weak solution is established, thanks to the uniform in time bounds on the potential vorticity. The solution is also shown to satisfy the initial and boundary conditions in the classical sense."
