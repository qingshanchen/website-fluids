abstract = "This work combines the consistency in lower-order differential operators with external approximations of functional spaces to obtain error estimates for finite difference finite volume schemes on unstructured non-uniform meshes. This combined approach is first applied to the one-dimensional elliptic boundary value problem on non-uniform meshes, and a first-order convergence rate is obtained, which agrees with the results previously reported. The approach is also applied to the staggered MAC scheme for the two-dimensional incompressible Stokes problem on unstructured meshes. A first-order convergence rate is obtained, which improves over a previously reported result in that it also holds on unstructured meshes. For both problems considered in this work, the convergence rate is one order higher on meshes satisfying special requirements."
