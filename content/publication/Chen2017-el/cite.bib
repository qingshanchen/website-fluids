 abstract = {This work combines the consistency in lower-order differential
operators with external approximations of functional spaces to
obtain error estimates for finite difference finite volume
schemes on unstructured non-uniform meshes. This combined
approach is first applied to the one-dimensional elliptic
boundary value problem on non-uniform meshes, and a first-order
convergence rate is obtained, which agrees with the results
previously reported. The approach is also applied to the
staggered MAC scheme for the two-dimensional incompressible
Stokes problem on unstructured meshes. A first-order convergence
rate is obtained, which improves over a previously reported
result in that it also holds on unstructured meshes. For both
problems considered in this work, the convergence rate is one
order higher on meshes satisfying special requirements.},
