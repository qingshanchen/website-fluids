  abstract = "Abstract The Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) is a new
              coupled Earth system model sponsored by the U.S Department of
              Energy. Here we present E3SM global simulations using active
              ocean and sea ice that are driven by the Coordinated Ocean-ice
              Reference Experiments II (CORE-II) interannual atmospheric
              forcing data set. The E3SM ocean and sea ice components are
              MPAS-Ocean and MPAS-Seaice, which use the Model for Prediction
              Across Scales (MPAS) framework and run on unstructured horizontal
              meshes. For this study, grid cells vary from 30 to 60 km for the
              low-resolution mesh and 6 to 18 km at high resolution. The
              vertical grid is a structured z-star coordinate and uses 60 and
              80 layers for low and high resolution, respectively. The
              lower-resolution simulation was run for five CORE cycles (310
              years) with little drift in sea surface temperature (SST) or heat
              content. The meridional heat transport (MHT) is within
              observational range, while the meridional overturning circulation
              at 26.5°N is low compared to observations. The largest
              temperature biases occur in the Labrador Sea and western boundary
              currents (WBCs), and the mixed layer is deeper than observations
              at northern high latitudes in the winter months. In the
              Antarctic, maximum mixed layer depths (MLD) compare well with
              observations, but the spatial MLD pattern is shifted relative to
              observations. Sea ice extent, volume, and concentration agree
              well with observations. At high resolution, the sea surface
              height compares well with satellite observations in mean and
              variability.",
