 abstract = {Two models based on the hydrostatic primitive equations are
proposed. The first model is the primitive equations with
partial viscosity only, and is oriented towards large-scale wave
structures in the ocean and atmosphere. The second model is the
viscous primitive equations with spectral eddy viscosity, and is
oriented towards turbulent geophysical flows. For both models,
the existence and uniqueness of global strong solutions are
established. For the second model, the convergence of the
solutions to the solutions of the classical primitive equations
as eddy viscosity parameters tend to zero is also established.},
