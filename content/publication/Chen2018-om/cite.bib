 abstract = {AbstractIn this paper, the application of the multilevel Monte
Carlo (MLMC) method to numerical simulations of turbulent flows
with uncertain parameters is investigated. Several strategies
for setting up the MLMC method are presented, and the advantages
and disadvantages of each strategy are also discussed. A
numerical experiment is carried out using an idealized model for
the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) with uncertain,
small-scale bottom topographic features. It is demonstrated that
unlike the pointwise solutions, the averaged volume transports
are correlated across grid resolutions, and the MLMC method can
increase simulation efficiency without losing accuracy in
uncertainty assessments.},
