 abstract = {The inviscid barotropic quasi-geostrophic equation with a
free surface is considered. The free surface mandates a
non-standard boundary condition. The global existence
existence and uniqueness of a weak solution is established,
thanks to the uniform in time bounds on the potential
vorticity. The solution is also shown to satisfy the initial
and boundary conditions in the classical sense.},
