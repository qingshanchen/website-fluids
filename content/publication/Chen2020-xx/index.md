abstract: An energy-conserving and an energy-and-enstrophy conserving
numerical schemes are derived, by approximating the Hamiltonian
formulation, based on the Poisson brackets and the
vorticity-divergence variables, of the inviscid shallow water
flows. The conservation of the energy and/or enstrophy stems from
skew-symmetry of the Poisson brackets, which is retained in the
discrete approximations. These schemes operate on unstructured
orthogonal dual meshes, over bounded or unbounded domains, and
they are also shown to possess the same optimal dispersive wave
relations as those of the Z-grid scheme.
