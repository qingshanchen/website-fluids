               numerical schemes are derived by approximating the Hamiltonian
               formulation of the inviscid shallow water flows based on the
               vorticity-divergence variables. These schemes also conserve the
               first-order moments such as mass and vorticity, as usual. The
               Conservative properties of the schemes stem from the
               skew-symmetry and singularities of the Poisson brackets, which
               are carefully retained in the discrete approximations. The
               schemes operate on unstructured orthogonal dual meshes, over
               bounded or unbounded domains, and they are also shown to possess
               the same optimal dispersive wave relations as those of the
               Z-grid scheme, which is a consequence of the use of the
               vorticity and divergence variables.",
