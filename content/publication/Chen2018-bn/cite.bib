 abstract = {The inviscid multi-layer quasi-geostrophic equations are
considered over an arbitrary bounded domain. The no-flux but
non-homogeneous boundary conditions are imposed to
accommodate the free fluctuations of the top and layer
interfaces. Using the barotropic and baroclinic modes in the
vertical direction, the elliptic system governing the
streamfunctions and the potential vorticity is decomposed
into a sequence of scalar elliptic boundary value problems,
where the regularity theories from the two-dimensional case
can be applied. With the initial potential vorticity being
essentially bounded, the multi-layer quasi-equations are
then shown to be globally well-posed, and the initial and
boundary conditions are satisfied in the classical sense.},
