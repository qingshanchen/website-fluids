  abstract = "The inviscid multi-layer quasi-geostrophic equations are
              considered over an arbitrary bounded domain. The no-flux but
              non-homogeneous boundary conditions are imposed to accommodate
              the free fluctuations of the top and layer interfaces. Using the
              barotropic and baroclinic modes in the vertical direction, the
              elliptic system governing the streamfunctions and the potential
              vorticity is decomposed into a sequence of scalar elliptic
              boundary value problems, where the regularity theories from the
              two-dimensional case can be applied. With the initial potential
              vorticity being essentially bounded, the multi-layer
              quasi-equations are then shown to be globally well-posed, and the
              initial and boundary conditions are satisfied in the classical
              sense.",
