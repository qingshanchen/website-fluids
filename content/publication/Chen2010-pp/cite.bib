 abstract = {The barotropic mode of the Primitive Equations is considered.
Thecorresponding equations resemble the Euler equations of
incompressible flows with marked differences. The existence and
uniqueness of solutions for the linearized equations is proven;
the proof is based on the study of a nonstandard boundary value
problem. In the nonlinear case, sev- eral schemes inspired by
the projection method are proposed and their stability is
studied. Finally, numerical simulations are described using one
of these schemes, closely related to the pressure correction
projection scheme.},
