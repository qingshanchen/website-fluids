 abstract = {In this article we propose finite-volume schemes for solving the
inviscid and viscous quasi-geostrophic equations on
coastal-conforming unstructured primal?dual meshes. Several
approaches for enforcing the boundary conditions are also
explored along with these schemes. The pure transport parts in
these schemes are shown to conserve the potential vorticity along
fluid paths in an averaged sense, and conserve the potential
enstrophy up to the time truncation errors. Numerical tests based
on the centroidal Voronoi?Delaunay meshes are performed to
confirm these properties, and to distinguish the dynamical
behaviours of these schemes. Finally some potential applications
of these schemes in different situations are discussed.},
